# Room Assignments

This project will take a list of available rooms and a list of scheduled events
and attempt to assign the best room to each event such that:

+ The room seats enough students to accomodate the event
+ The rooms are not double booked for any portion of any event
+ The rooms have the necessary facilities to handle the event (ie science lab)
